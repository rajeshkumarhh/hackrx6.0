## üìÑ Document Summarization System

### Workflow:
1. **Ingest & Preprocess**: Accepts `.pdf`, `.csv`, `.docx` files; extracts text (PyPDF) and tables (Camelot)
2. **LLM Summarization**: Generates separate summaries for text and tables using GPT
3. **Merge & Finalize**: Combines both into a concise, actionable summary
